# PenetrationTesting
I plan to redo the home labs I did years ago and screenshot them for my github
I completed hands-on penetration testing training using the textbook "Penetration Testing: A Hands-on Introduction to Hacking" - by Georgia Weidman
3 Favorite Exercises:
1.	Conducted buffer overflow attack on a vulnerable application (War FTP) using Immunity Debugger. I used fuzzing techniques, custom python scripts, and the C programming language to write specially crafted shellcode to help execute the attack. Circumvented a buffer overflow countermeasure such as DEP, to ensure successful execution
2.	Gained root access to compromised systems using Metasploit. Implemented reverse shells after discovering vulnerabilities. Configured exploit settings on host and target machines to allow successful execution. Sometimes required to pivot to multiple devices using Metasploit and other tools. Target machines include Windows XP, Windows 7, and Ubuntu 8
3.	Gained root access to a virtual android phone using Android Studio. Exported payload as an executable using Metasploit and tricked the target device into downloading the exploit
